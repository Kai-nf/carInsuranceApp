# Car Insurance App (CodeNection Hackathon Project)

## üöó Overview
This project is built for the **CodeNection Hackathon**.  
It is a **digital-first car insurance platform** that combines typo detection, decentralized insurance data storage, and vehicle damage evaluation using machine learning.

### ‚ú® Key Features
- **Smart Typo Checking**  
  Detects typos in user input for car brand, model, and validity of manufacturing year, then predicts the correct entry using a machine learning model (K-Nearest Neighbours model).

- **Decentralized Insurance Data**  
  A complete, secure, blockchain-backed system to store car details, user policies, and insurance schemes ‚Äî making it fully digitalized and easily accessible. Blockchain data storage ensures transparency for validation, yet providing satisfying data security.

- **AI-Powered Damage Assessment**  
  Uses **YOLOv8 image processing** to detect vehicles from accident photos and evaluate the worn-out/damage percentage automatically. Users are required to take 3 photos of the car from different angles, which are rear view, left-side-front and right-side-front.

- **User-Friendly & Secure**  
  Designed with a simple interface, reliable backend, and robust data storage.
